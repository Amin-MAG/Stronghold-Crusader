# Stronghold-Crusader

In this project, I used JavaFX and Swing to recreate the 2.5 dimension environment of Stronghold Crusader from scratch. Implementing the animations of the soldiers and NPCs was possible by using free Stronghold's assets. 
It's achievable to create new maps by generating JSON files.

> Stronghold is a series of real-time strategy video games.

It is almost impossible to implement the whole game with JavaFX; we could not complete the project.
